# fast3Dinterp
This project contains an implementation of a Gauss-Seidel interpolation function to fill in missing data (NaN values) in a 3D array.

## Features

- Iteratively interpolates NaN values using neighboring pixels.
- Option to set an initial value for faster convergence.
- Configurable tolerance and maximum iteration count.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacka-1/fast3Dinterp.git
cd fast3Dinterp
pip install -r requirements.txt
